# Things tried 
##### `s_`
printing stuff out of src/modules/src/kalman_core/mm_sweep_angles.c ([[kalmanCoreUpdateWithSweepAngles]]), namely the `s_` parameter which corresponds to the sensor position within the world frame. 
- Got this out when on the flat table:
|     | x      | y       |     | z       |
| --- | ------ | ------- | --- | ------- |
| s   | 0.0149 | -0.0076 |     | -0.0001 |

When I moved it around....
| x         | y         | z         |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| 015697    | 0.005451  | -0.002262 |
| -0.01597  | 0.005     | -0.002262 |
| -0.014097 | -0.007526 | 0.005086  |
| 0.014097  | 0.007526  | 0.005086  |

I tried flipping the sensor:
| x         | y         | z         |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| 0.01533   | 0.00677   | 0.000613  |
| -0.015336 | -0.006784 | -0.000131 |
| -0.015336 | -0.006784 | -0.000131 |
| -0.014629 | 0.008198  | -7.3E-05  |
| -0.014629 | 0.008198  | -7.3E-05  |
| 0.014629  | -0.008198 | 7.3E-05   |
| 0.014629  | -0.008198 | 7.3E-05   |
* There's not enough here to conclude. I'll place it on more of an offset from the y and z axis to determine. 

Holy cow, realized I'm only looking at the $R_{cf} \cdot s$ instead of the $\vec{s}$ with the position taken into account.

Started looking at the right thing (`pcf`), and it gave me much better results:
- With no rotation:
| x         | y         | z  |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| 0.01533   | 0.00677   | 0.000613  |
| -0.015336 | -0.006784 | -0.000131 |
| -0.015336 | -0.006784 | -0.000131 |
| -0.014629 | 0.008198  | -7.3E-05  |
| -0.014629 | 0.008198  | -7.3E-05  |
| 0.014629  | -0.008198 | 7.3E-05   |
| 0.014629  | -0.008198 | 7.3E-05   |

- With rotation:

That wasn't helpful. Changing to look at the position of the sensor from the position of the basestation. That's the `sr` parameter.

No rotation:
|         | x    | y     | z     |
| ------- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Average | 1.1  | -.126 | .1256 |
| Median  | 1.02 | 0.07  | 0.229 |

Rotation
|         | x      | y       | z     |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| Average | 1.069  | -0.5432 | .162  |
| Median  | 1.1088 | .0732   | 0.2289 |

Not enough of a difference...
